    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2> Devin Howell</h2>
    <p>My name is Devin Howell and I am often just called Devin. I am planning on going through software engineering and
        hopefully one day I can get into AI. I like to code, learn things, play games, and snowboard. I am newly married
        at just over 4 months. I am currently a welder and will be making a big switch as soon as i get further through
        school.</p>
    <p>I like the culture of how kind and respectful people are at BYUI and see the advantage of web design because it
        teaches a lot of aspects such as front end design, functionality, and backend that are easily translatable to
        other fields. Ive been a member my entire life.</p>
